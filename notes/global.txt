printing only single page

/ -> creating the page and tries to save
  // where it will go on saving ???
  // => /window/ ?
  // => /<name>/ ?


// on usage
  // let's say that user wanna open another *window in the PWD
  // how it should work ?

  // then *window will be only for grouping things
  // searcher will search and load the information in the *window

  // editing is avaliable in the main *window
  // it means that every *window is readable and editable only for user


// let's talk about user registration and usage
// everyone can clone this repository and deploy it whatever host wants

// writing the DNS (bit.ly) thing for them to save


// let's talk about database registration and database usage
// user will open plagin that allows to write the database information
// then user can use this information for another plagins

// like on get use *this.database


// filling the database


writing the connector to the database
and whatever user wants will create in the web

creating database, tables, and structures for them

// now i need only the

/ root -> only for user it's a dashboard, for others it'll be anything,
that *this.user wants


// if it's my web page then i can


sh1chan.com/    <user>
                / (dashboard)


sh1chan -> route.register(/<user>/*)
                          // (*) -> user registrations


user -> creating -> *window


need to write route registrations

route -> data gio location from the database

user can use his own database to store the data
or use root

// how to structure the database so root can create his own data
// and let users save or delete their databases and tables


// we'll call it query programming
